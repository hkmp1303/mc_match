  1. **Select Preferences:** Enter your motorcycle's characteristics (e.g., horsepower, torque, budget).
  2. **Price Estimation:** The property details are used to estimate the market price of the motorcycle.

## Data Source
The motorcycle specifications and market data used in this project are sourced from [2023 Bike Model Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peshimaammuzammil/2023-bike-model-dataset-all-data-you-need?select=bikes_data.csv) available on Kaggle.

This dataset provides comprehensive technical specifications for a wide range of motorcycle models, which serves as the foundation for our matching algorithms and market valuation estimates.
